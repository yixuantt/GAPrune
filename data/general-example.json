    "positive": "It is widely assumed that architectural success was the product of a process of trial and error, with progressively less trial and more replication as the results of the process proved increasingly satisfactory. What is termed vernacular architecture continues to be produced in many parts of the world. Indeed, vernacular buildings make up most of the built world that people experience every day. Early human settlements were mostly rural. Due to a surplus in production the economy began to expand resulting in urbanization thus creating urban areas which grew and evolved very rapidly in some cases, such as that of Çatal Höyük in Anatolia and Mohenjo Daro of the Indus Valley Civilization in modern-day Pakistan.",
    "negative": "Gothic architecture is a style of architecture that flourished during the high and late medieval period. It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. Originating in 12th-century France and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as Opus Francigenum (\"French work\") with the term Gothic first appearing during the later part of the Renaissance. Its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault and the flying buttress. Gothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great cathedrals, abbeys and churches of Europe. It is also the architecture of many castles, palaces, town halls, guild halls, universities and to a less prominent extent, private dwellings, such as dorms and rooms."

Sources very close to Kim as well as sources connected with \" Real Housewives of Beverly Hills \" tell TMZ, she was unable to cope with some pretty terrible things going on in her life.-- Her ex-husband Monty, who still lives with her, is dying of stage 4 cancer.-- Her son Chad was released from UCLA Medical Center hours before the meltdown.-- She's under financial stress. Contrary to reports, she's getting no money for child support.-- Kim is trying to plan her daughter Brooke's official wedding. But the real trigger ... we're told earlier in the evening, Kim went to Brooke's house, where they watched the 3-part reunion. Kim had put it off because it was too upsetting, but she had to binge watch in order to fulfill her obligation to blog about the shows. And reliving what went down crushed her. We're told Kim has been deeply upset over Lisa Vanderpump and Lisa Rinna. Kim believes Vanderpump had intentionally driven a wedge between her and sister Kyle. On the show, Vanderpump urged them to reconcile, but Kim claims off camera Vanderpump told Kyle that Kim didn't want her at Brooke's wedding ... which infuriated Kyle and deeply hurt Kim. Our sources say the cumulative stress was too much for Kim to bear. We're told she left Brooke's house and ended up alone at the Polo Lounge at the Bev Hills Hotel. It's unclear what if anything she drank there, but Kim has told friends a group of people at a table invited her to sit at around 1:30 AM, but the maitre d' wasn't having it and ordered Kim out. As we reported, the hotel people say Kim got belligerent, wouldn't leave the restaurant, ended up in the bathroom where cops dragged her out. She was booked for public drunkenness, resisting arrest, trespass and battery on a cop.

Surgeons work in a number of settings including hospitals, clinics and dental offices. A surgeon’s wages will vary depending on the location and the setting. Area of specialization also plays a part in how much they earn. The assumption was made that the Surgeons reflected here were working an average of 40 hours per week with a total of 2080 hours per year. Median Hourly & Annual Data Hourly The mean Surgeon salary is $112.09 per hour. The lowest 10% earn less than $61.00 per hour and those in the upper 10% earn more than $100.00 per hour.

A doctor who isn't a good businessman will not make much money, neither will a doctor who doesn't get along with his customers. well i m not sure exactly but i suppose out of the total fees during a surgery affair,the surgeon is the person who takes away around 50-60% of it.so even for minor surgeries they earn above a lac ,leave apart major ones.

    "positive": "The Significance of the Play Within the Play Structure of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” by William Shakespeare Author Exact author Home » Literature » Poetry » The Significance of the Play Within the Play Structure of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” by William Shakespeare The Significance of the Play Within the Play Structure of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” by William Shakespeare Pages: 1 2 One of the notable characteristics of the dramatic construction and presentation of William Shakespeare’s play A Midsummer Night’s Dream is the fact that it contains two distinctly different plays within the larger framework of the main play. The author’s skillful development and juxtaposition of these simultaneously unfolding plays serves the function of reiterating some of A Midsummer Night’s Dream’s principal themes. Similarly, the utilization of this multiple play structure also situates Shakespeare in relationship to the creative process and his own work. Furthermore, the three-play structure allows the reader to question the very nature of creativity and of love. The play staged by the mechanicals is particularly effective in this regard. The comic, lighthearted tone of the players as they prepare for and fulfill their roles in Pyramus and Thisbe serves as a welcome contrast to the more dramatic circumstances between the  women characters in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”  and Hermia, Lysander, Helen, and Demetrius, as well as the more fanciful plot involving the faeries. Even more than these other plays, the play of the mechanicals raises a number of important questions about life, love, and creative production and performance. The lower class laborers who comprise the unlikely dramatic troupe which will perform Pyramus and Thisbe are introduced to the reader in Act I, Scene II of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Everything about these players is comical, from their most superficial characteristics to their deeply embedded personality traits which include a habit of bumbling, mispronouncing words so that the meanings of their sentences are completely and comically misconstrued, and generally playing the part of fools. As soon as the reader learns of the rag-tag actors’ names—Bottom, Flute, Snug, Snout, Starveling, and Quince– he or she becomes immediately oriented to the fact that the introduction of these characters is intended to disrupt the larger narrative of the play and if anything, provide further comic relief to the slightly more serious (although still lighthearted) main narrative. Additionally, these goofy characters also exist to raise questions about the subjects and  themes in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”  that are most present throughout the work. This observation is confirmed with each new detail that the reader learns about each of the tradesmen/actor characters. Nick Bottom is a weaver who, like his fellow tradesmen, has no previous acting credentials. In fact, it is not entirely clear how these men have come together or who decided that they were “worthy” of putting on a play. This issue of worthiness, or fitness, for playing certain roles, whether on the stage or on life, is a central theme and preoccupation in A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Upon learning that he will be assigned to play the lead role of Pyramus, “a lover that kills himself most gallant for love” (Shakespeare 17), Bottom asserts that he will be so effective in his role that he will elicit the audience members’ tears: “I will move storms,” he proclaims to his fellow actors (Shakespeare 17). Flute is also comical and in many ways, he acts as a comic foil for Bottom, especially as Bottom ends up taking himself seriously, despite the fact that the audience is well aware of the situation. For Flute’s part, he begs not to be cast as a female character because he has “a beard coming” (Shakespeare 18). Bottom will also evidence a preoccupation with his beard later in the play, as he questions the other cast members how he should wear his beard so that it will be most appropriate and most convincing for his role. While these details may seem to be little more than humoro",
    "negative": "Introduction to Shakespeare's Clown Feste from Twelfth Night   Shakespeare's Characters: Feste (Twelfth Night) From The Works of William Shakespeare. Vol. 16. Ed. Evangeline Maria O'Connor. J.D. Morris and Co. The Clown in this play, who, I am inclined to think, should bear his name all through by as good a right as Touchstone, is a remarkable creation, and very essential to the knitting and coherence of the general play. His musical talent is most diversified; he gives as readily and with equal effect the tender love song suited to the dreamy and poetical being of the Duke, or the noisy catch that shakes the rafters and calls up Malvolio at midnight. Thus catholic in his artistic range, he has a not less wide intellectual scope. He plumbs the depth accurately of his mistress's exhausted sorrow, penetrates the destiny of Maria and Sir Toby's weak pia mater, holds up a mirror to the opalescent humours of the Duke, and takes remarkably good care of his own economical resources, by asking on every occasion when he is safe to obtain � yet free from slyness withal, genial and enjoyable, as he is free of speech. Still, apart from a certain degree of loyalty to his mistress, he knows the world too well � this it is to be wise and to suffer for it, to remain very long in society of the same tone, or to feel much sympathy for anybody, or consequently to get much in return. With no great interest in the practical jests and bear-baitings that are rife around him, he does not refuse, however, to gratify his pique of profession, by lending a helping hand in duping the churlish steward. Lloyd: Critical Essays on the Plays of Shakespeare. ______________________ Of all Shakespeare's clowns, he is the best endowed with a many-sided mirth, as indeed he should be to pass lightly through the mingled romance and roystering of the play and favor all its moods. The sentiment of the Duke is as inebriated as the revelling which Malvolio rebukes. Olivia's protracted grief for her brother is carefully cosseted by her, as if on purpose to give the Clown an opportunity. Clo. Good madonna, why mournest thou? Oliv. Good fool, for my brother's death. Clo. I think his soul is in hell, madonna. Oliv. I know his soul is in heaven, fool. Clo. The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul being in heaven. � Take away the fool, gentlemen. All the characters, noble and common, have some weakness which he intuitively rallies. The charm of the comedy lies in these unsubstantial moods of the chief personages which consort with the more substantial whims and appetites of the others. The only sobriety is vested in the Clown; for all his freaks have a consistent disposition. So the lovely poetry of the mock mourners alternates with the tipsy prose of the genuine fleshly fellows. Their hearty caterwauling penetrates to Olivia's fond seclusion, and breaks up her brooding. Feste is everywhere at home. When he plays the curate's part, Malvolio beseechingly cries, \"Sir Topas, Sir Topas!\" The Clown says aside, \"Nay, I am for all waters\" � that is, for topaz, diamond, gems of the first water, all many-colored facets, I'll reflect. And he does so in this conversation which he holds with Malvolio, who says, \"I am no more mad than you are; make the trial of it in any constant question.\" Then Feste airs his learning: \"What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild-fowl?\" and makes his question lead up to a sharp retort, when Malvolio answers, \"That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird\"; for then Feste says, \"Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam.\" For it was a country notion that the woodcock was the foolishest of birds; so he translates Malvolio's grandam into one, and leaves him to inherit her absence of wits. And Malvolio was so devoured by mortification and anxiety that he does not notice when Feste cannot restrain his burlesquing knack, but makes the pretended curate say that Malvolio's cell \"hath bay-windows, t"
